# 🌌 Library of Echoes

**A mystical, anonymous message platform where thoughts echo through layers of consciousness.**

## 🎯 Concept

Library of Echoes is a futuristic social platform where users contribute single-line thoughts anonymously. These messages are processed into **Layers**, **Rooms**, and **Epochs** by the system, creating an evolving collective consciousness.

- ✍️ Users write only **one line** at a time
- 🌑 Messages are organized into **9 mystical layers** based on volume
- 🏛️ Each layer contains multiple **rooms** that distribute messages
- 📊 When a threshold is reached, a **Babel Moment** occurs - the epoch closes with statistics and a new age begins

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Web:** Next.js 15 + TypeScript
- **Mobile:** React Native (Expo + Expo Router)
- **Backend:** Supabase (Postgres + Edge Functions)
- **Deployment:** Vercel (web) + Expo EAS (mobile)
